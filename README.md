#### Patching

#### AWS Linux Systems

1. Inventory Management
    * Use AWS Systems Manager to automatically discover and manage your Linux instances on AWS.
    * Categorize instances by environment, application, or other criteria to tailor patching schedules.

2. Patch Baseline Configuration
    * Define a patch baseline in AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager for your Linux distributions (e.g., Amazon Linux, Ubuntu). This includes specifying approved or rejected patches and patch compliance levels.
    * Assign the patch baseline to your instance groups based on the categories defined earlier.

3. Automation and Scheduling
    * Schedule patching windows using Maintenance Windows in AWS Systems Manager, ensuring minimal impact on production workloads.
    * Automate patch deployment to automatically apply approved patches during these windows.

4. Testing
    * Use a subset of instances or a staging environment to test patches before wide-scale deployment.
    * Monitor for issues and rollback if necessary using AWS Systems Manager automation documents.

5. Compliance Monitoring and Reporting
    * Utilize AWS Systems Manager Compliance to monitor and report on patch compliance across your Linux instances.
    * Address any non-compliant instances promptly to ensure security and compliance.

#### On-premises Linux Systems
1. Inventory Management
    * Utilize a configuration management database (CMDB) or inventory tool to maintain an up-to-date list of Linux servers and their roles.
    * Group servers by function, application, or environment for targeted patching.

2. Patch Baseline Configuration
    * Define a patch policy that outlines the frequency of patching, types of patches (security, critical updates), and exceptions.
    * Establish a process for reviewing and approving patches before deployment.

3. Patch Deployment
    * Utilize patch management tools (e.g., Red Hat Satellite, Spacewalk, or Landscape) to deploy patches. Consider open-source tools like Ansible for automation.
    * Schedule patch deployments during off-peak hours to minimize impact. Ensure patches are applied in a staged manner, starting with development, then staging, and finally production environments.

4. Testing
    * Test patches on a representative sample of systems before broad deployment.
    * Monitor system and application logs for issues post-patch and have a rollback plan in place.

5. Compliance Monitoring and Reporting
    * Regularly audit systems for patch compliance using your chosen patch management tool or custom scripts.
    * Generate compliance reports for internal and external audit purposes. Address any compliance issues immediately.
## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Plan for AWS Linux Systems

1. Pre-Deployment Preparations

      * Ensure that you have a recent backup of the system and data. Utilize AWS Backup or your preferred backup solution to create snapshots or backups of your instances and volumes.
      * Test the backup restoration process regularly to confirm that you can quickly revert to a pre-patch state if necessary.

2. Automated Rollback Using AWS Systems Manager

      * Use AWS Systems Manager State Manager to create a document that specifies the pre-patch state of the instances or uses previously known good configurations.
      * In the event of a failed patch deployment, trigger the State Manager document to revert the instances to their previous configurations.

3. Manual Rollback Procedures

      * If automated rollback is not feasible, manually stop the affected instances.
      * Restore from the pre-patch backups or snapshots to revert the instances to their pre-patch state.
      * Restart the instances and validate that the services are running as expected.

4. Post-Rollback Actions

      * Analyze logs and monitoring data to understand the cause of the issue.
      * Implement necessary changes to avoid similar issues in future patch deployments.

### Rollback Plan for On-premises Linux Systems
1. Pre-Deployment Preparations

      * Ensure comprehensive backups are taken before patching, including system states, application data, and databases.
      * Validate the backup integrity and restoration process periodically.

2. Using Configuration Management Tools for Rollback

      * Utilize configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to snapshot the system state before applying patches. These tools can also be used to automate the rollback process.
      * In case of a patch issue, use these tools to apply the pre-patch configuration to the servers.

3. Manual Rollback Procedures

      * If automated tools are not in place or fail, manually remove the problematic patches using package managers like yum or apt-get to revert to previous versions of the packages.
      * For more severe issues, restore the systems from the backups taken before patching. This might involve re-imaging the server and restoring data from backups.

4. Post-Rollback Actions

      * Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the cause of the failure. This might involve reviewing patch notes, system logs, and application logs.
      * Adjust the patch testing and deployment process to prevent recurrence of the issue.

#### Backing Up Databases and Storage On-Premises

1. Database Backups
      * Backup Types: Understand the different backup types (full, incremental, and differential) and how they fit into your backup strategy. Full backups capture the entire database, while incremental and differential backups capture changes since the last full or incremental backup, respectively.
      * Automation: Use database management tools or scripts to automate the backup process. Tools such as Cron jobs for scheduling scripts, or database-specific tools like mysqldump for MySQL, can be used to automate backups.
      * Backup Verification: Regularly verify the integrity of backups by performing test restores. This ensures that your backups are both complete and usable.
      * Offsite Storage: Store backup copies offsite or in a secure, geographically separate location to protect against physical disasters. This can be done through tape backups, external drives, or using cloud storage as an offsite option.

2. Storage Backups
      * Volume Snapshots: For on-premises storage systems, utilize volume snapshots if supported by your storage solution. Snapshots provide a point-in-time copy of the data and can be used for quick restores.
      * RAID Arrays: Implement RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) configurations to provide redundancy and improve data availability. Note that RAID is not a backup solution but can protect against hardware failure.
      * Network-Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Networks (SAN): For larger environments, consider using NAS or SAN solutions, which often include built-in backup and replication features.

#### Backing Up Databases and Storage in AWS

1. Database Backups
      * AWS RDS Automated Backups: AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) supports automated backups, which can be configured to create daily snapshots and retain transaction logs, allowing for point-in-time recovery.
      * AWS Backup: Use AWS Backup to manage and automate backups across AWS services, including RDS, DynamoDB, EFS, and EC2. AWS Backup can centralize and automate backup policies, providing a unified backup solution.
      * Cross-Region Replication: For critical databases, consider enabling cross-region replication to maintain a live copy of your database in a different AWS region for disaster recovery purposes.

2. Storage Backups
      * Amazon S3 Versioning: Enable versioning on Amazon S3 buckets to keep multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. This can protect against accidental deletions and overwrites.
      * Amazon EBS Snapshots: Create snapshots of Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes to back up EC2 instances. These snapshots can be automated using Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager and copied across regions for disaster recovery.
      * Glacier and Deep Archive: For long-term, cost-effective storage, consider moving older backups to Amazon Glacier or Glacier Deep Archive. This is ideal for data that is infrequently accessed but needs to be retained for regulatory or compliance reasons.

##### Best Practices for Both Environments
* Regularly Test Restores: Periodically test the restore process from your backups to ensure you can recover your data reliably and within your organization's recovery time objectives (RTOs).
* Encrypt Sensitive Data: Ensure that backups of sensitive or regulated data are encrypted both in transit and at rest.
* Retention Policy: Define a clear retention policy that meets both operational and compliance needs, ensuring that you keep backups for as long as necessary but no longer.

Documentation and Training: Document your backup and restore procedures clearly, and ensure that your team is trained on these processes.
By following these detailed strategies for backing up databases and storage, organizations can ensure their data remains safe, secure, and recoverable in both on-premises and AWS environments.
